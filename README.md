# ExpressJS-Cubicle
This project was part of SoftUni's Express.js workshop. Here's my perspective on what I did:

## Project Overview
In this workshop, I was given the task to build a web application called "Cubicle." The purpose of this application is to allow users to explore a variety of Rubik cubes from around the world and even add their own discoveries.

## What I Worked On
Cube Model: I had the responsibility of defining what a Rubik cube should look like in our application. Think of it as setting up the blueprint for each cube, specifying details like its name, description, image, and difficulty level.

## Routes: 
I needed to create different paths or pages within the application. For example, there's a page for showing all the cubes, another for an "about" section, one for creating a new cube, and more. I even made sure there's a page to handle any unknown routes gracefully.

## Templates with Handlebars: 
To make the application look good and functional, I used templates with Handlebars. These templates allowed me to create the actual web pages and display data seamlessly.

## Search Feature: 
One of the features was a search bar. If someone just searches for a cube's name without specifying its difficulty, the application displays all cubes with different difficulty levels. It's all about making things user-friendly!
